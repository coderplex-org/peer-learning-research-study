# Peer Learning Research Study

### Hypothesis : 
A peer-learning program would create a more positive learning output than a traditional classroom program does for learning any topic. 

### Method : 
We will create a co-learning space, where people who are interested in learning any specific software development domain or tool can apply and join. We will be selecting everyone in groups, meaning unless there is at least one more person who has applied for learning the same topic or domain, they will not be able to utilize the space. Once such a group is formed, they will be instructed to create their own schedule (on a daily or weekly basis), based on whatever works for them.

We will provide the group some level of guidance on how to approach learning that topic. We will encourage them to create their own curriculum, and we will encourage them to focus on problem solving, optimization, project building, and primarily peer-learning. They will help each other learn, and they will work on projects together. 

### Measurement : 
We will try to use multiple measurements
- Self evaluation and feedback on their experience on a weekly basis (do they think their learning has improved or not)
- Performance in coding challenges (if relevant)
